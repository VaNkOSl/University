                    <p class="overview-title"><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                    <p class="overview-title">The BMW X6 M is a sloped-back brute-ute that packs a potent punch. It balances its high-octane antics with an interior that wraps its occupants in rich materials and a wealth of standard features. The X6 M offers much of the same content as its conventional looking sibling, the X5 M SUV, but thanks to its fastback roofline does so with slightly less cargo space and slightly more style. Propulsion is generated by a twin-turbo V-8 fitted with a hybrid system, which churns out 617 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque. We’ve lauded the X6 M for its effortless speed and aggressive handling, and BMW claims that it's smoothed the edge off of its famously rocky ride this year. We’ll see. At the very least, we feel certain that the X6 M still has the chops to remain competitive against the likes of the Audi RS Q8 and Porsche Cayenne Coupe.</p>
                    <img src="../images/bmw4.jpg" alt="" class="overview-image">
  
                    <p class="new-for-title"><strong>What's New for 2022?</strong></p>
                    <p class="new-for-text">BMW has given the X6 M a facelift for the 2024 model year, complete with revised sheet metal that creates a more chiseled look, crisp exterior lighting elements, a spruced-up interior with a new curved center display, and a new V-8 engine and eight-speed transmission fitted with a 48-volt mild hybrid system. Additionally, the X6 M is now offered exclusively as a Competition model with 617 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque. The German marque has outfitted the high-performance fastback SUV with other enhancements, too, including new carbon shift paddles, more standard safety tech, an M-specific version of iDrive, and more. There are also three new colors: Brooklyn Grey Metallic, Isle of Man Green Metallic, and Frozen Pure Grey Metallic.</p>
  
                    <p class="engine-title"><strong>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</strong></p>
                    <p class="engine-text">The X6 M is motivated by a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that’s paired with a 48-volt mild hybrid system, which incorporates an electric motor mounted in the eight-speed automatic transmission. Combined output is the same 617 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque generated by earlier, non-hybrid Competition models. We’ve yet to get behind the wheel of the new hybridized version, which means we haven’t run it through our instrumented testing regimen either. That said, we expect the performance to at least match or exceed pre-facelift models. During our previous drive in the X6 M Competition, we lauded its lightning-quick acceleration, staggering cornering grip, and strong, fade-free brakes. While it rode smooth and steady on the highway, its large wheels and stiff springs contributed to a rocky ride on uneven roads. We appreciate the fact that this drivetrain can be told to distribute power to all four wheels for maximum traction or have most of it sent rearward for sharper handling. In addition to its selectable drive modes, including customizable settings that can be activated via steering-wheel-mounted buttons, the X6 M even features adjustable brake-pedal feedback. The BMW also has standard adaptive dampers and a set of staggered wheels measuring at 21-inches in the front and, but a pair of 22-inches in the rear.</p>

                    <p class="fuel-title"><strong>Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG</strong></p>
                    <p class="fuel-text">For 2024, BMW added a mild hybrid system to the X6 M, but the SUV's EPA fuel economy ratings remained the same as before. The X6 M receives an EPA-estimated 13 mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway. These ratings are exactly what the X5 M earned. Since we haven't been able to test either BMW on our 75-mph highway fuel-economy route, which is part of our extensive testing regimen, we can't evaluate their real-world efficiency, but we'll update this space after we do. For more information about the X6 M's fuel economy, visit <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.shtml">the EPA's website.</a></p>
  
                    <p class="interior-title"><strong>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</strong></p>
                    <p class="interior-text">Sportiness and luxuriousness collide inside the X6 M, which boasts carbon-fiber accents and standard leather upholstery. There's also no shortage of high-tech features thanks to a curved center display that seamlessly bridges the digital gauge cluster with the infotainment system’s touchscreen. Those are accompanied by niceties such as ambient interior lighting, available massaging front seats with heating and ventilation, heated rear seats, heated/cooled cup holders, and much more. Interior cubby storage is highlighted by a coverable bin below the center stack and a useful center-console bin. While its coupe-like profile doesn't affect how comfortable it is for either front- and back-seat passengers, the sloping roofline does reduce visibility out back as well as cargo space. The traditional X5 M provides 34 cubic feet behind the back row while the X6 M has only 27 cubes.</p>

                    <p class="safety-title"><strong>Safety and Driver-Assistance Features</strong></p>
                    <p class="safety-text">Every X6 M has copious <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a31249313/2020-bmw-x6-m-drive/">driver-assistance technology </a> such as blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert as well as additional options. The X6 M also offers standard Maneuver Assistant, which can store and reproduce movements even in reverse; drivers can also execute this function on their smartphones.
