                  <p class="overview-text">
                    The 2022 Porsche Cayenne has a particular set of skills—specifically those that have to do with driving enjoyment. Despite being a two-row luxury SUV with a heavy curb weight, it moves deliberately and gracefully. Every Cayenne has a cohesive powertrain, but their potency and fuel efficiency vary due to the sheer variety. There's a stout 335-hp turbo V-6, a gutsier 434-hp twin-turbo V-6, and a 460-hp twin-turbo V-8 reserved for the performance-oriented GTS. There's a 455-hp plug-in hybrid, too, that's quick on the street and friendliest to the environment. Inside, every Cayenne is roomy and sturdily built, and Porsche allows extensive personalization thanks to countless individual options. Be careful, though, as they can quickly balloon the bottom line.

                  <p class="new-for-text">
                    For 2022, the Cayenne receives updates to its infotainment system. With the latest generation of Porsche Communication Management (PCM) comes enhanced support for Apple products, including wireless Apple CarPlay. Android Auto finally joins the party, too. Porsche says that the navigation system has been revamped for improved clarity and quicker route processing. Plus, the voice-recognition software is said to better recognize instructions. This sixth-gen PCM now offers over-the-air technology so that it can be wirelessly updated in the future. A Platinum Edition package, which adds satin-finishes on the SUV's exterior trim and unique 21-inch wheels, is now available on the base Cayenne as well as the S and E-Hybrid models.

                  <p class="engine-title"><strong>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</strong></p>
                  <p class="engine-text">
                    If you want more giddy-up than what the base Cayenne's 335-hp turbo V-6 provides, the 434-hp Cayenne S offers an even zestier setup courtesy of its twin-turbo V-6. The plug-in hybrid (called the E-Hybrid) marries an electric motor and a turbocharged V-6 for a combined 455 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque. The Cayenne GTS boasts a 460-hp twin-turbo V-8 with a great-sounding exhaust note and breathtaking acceleration. All engines pair with an astute eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. While making anything that weighs more than two tons move gracefully is challenging, the engineers in Stuttgart were successful with the Cayenne. The S model that we tested moved quietly and steadily at highway speeds before seamlessly transitioning to twisty sections, where it showcased surprising athleticism for its size. However, the largest rollers diminish its ride quality on uneven roads. Most models have performance options that include adaptive dampers with or without an adjustable air suspension, four-wheel steering for improved maneuverability, and active anti-roll bars for flatter cornering. The Cayenne's brakes can be upgraded to Porsche's tungsten-coated iron rotors (called Porsche Surface Coated Brakes, or PSCB) or costly carbon-ceramic stoppers. The base model we tested had neither setup nor still needed only 159 feet to stop from 70 mph.

                  <p class="fuel-title"><strong>Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG</strong></p>
                  <p class="fuel-text">
                    The Cayenne E-Hybrid is the thriftiest of the bunch, earning a combined city and highway rating of 21 mpg. It also has an all-electric range of 17 miles. The base Cayenne and Cayenne S share a 22-mpg highway rating, but in the city, they're rated at 18 and 17 mpg, respectively. The GTS has estimates of 15 mpg city and 19 highway. The Cayenne S we evaluated on our 75-mph highway route, which is part of our extensive testing regimen, earned 25 mpg—matching the E-Hybrid we tested. Despite its unimpressive highway number, the plug-in hybrid is the most eco-friendly option for folks who live in urban areas.

                  <p class="interior-title"><strong>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</strong></p>
                  <p class="interior-text">
                    Porsche essentially provides a blank canvas inside the Cayenne for customers to outfit as they see fit. Everything from the interior trim to the seatbelt colors to the surface materials can be individually selected. The driver faces a snazzy gauge cluster with an analog tachometer flanked by two 7.0-inch screens that display selectable information. In addition to traditional options such as heated and ventilated front and rear seats, the Cayenne offers desirable upgrades, including more supportive seats, massaging front seats, four-zone climate control, and more. Whereas the rival Audi Q7 and the Volvo XC90 have three rows, the Porsche has only two. Still, its back seat is adjustable and provides plenty of stretch-out space. The Cayenne entices Porsche enthusiasts with ample passenger capacity and cargo volume, which are obviously far greater than any 911's. It's the largest Porsche SUV and provides 27 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats and up to 60 cubes with the seats folded flat. Interior cubby storage is unremarkable, with most small items seeking refuge in the door pockets or the shallow center-console bin. Every Cayenne includes a power-operated liftgate; the optional passive-entry system (called Comfort Access) allows it to be opened or closed with a foot gestur

                  <p class="infotainment-title"><strong>Infotainment and Connectivity</strong></p>
                  <p class="infotainment-text">
                    The infotainment system uses a standard 12.3-inch touchscreen mounted in the middle of the dashboard. Its slick interface includes a configurable home menu and many personalized settings. While the system was responsive and easy to operate during our testing, the screen attracted smudges. A rotary controller would help reduce distractions during driving. Every Cayenne has Porsche Connect Plus, which includes a Wi-Fi hotspot as well as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A set of upgraded audio systems includes a 14-speaker Bose unit or a much pricier Burmester setup that pumps 1455 watts through 21 speakers. An available rear-seat entertainment system attaches two 10.0-inch displays to the back of the front-seat headrests.

                  <p class="safety-text">
                    The Cayenne is available with a bevy of <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g27612164/car-safety-features/">driver-assistance technology</a>to help keep occupants safe.
